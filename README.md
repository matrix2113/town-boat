# Town Boat
Town Boat is made for a gaming discord server to fit certain needs. The bot is public if you are creating any discord server in general.

# Selfhosting
Documentation for self-hosting will be coming out soon. We recommend `Python 3.8` running the bot through `pipenv`.

**Please note that Python 3.9 is not fully supported yet**
